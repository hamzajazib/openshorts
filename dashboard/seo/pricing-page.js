/* /pricing: the plans as a page of their own.
 *
 * Until October 2026 /pricing was a 301 to the homepage table (/#pricing). A
 * redirect to an anchor cannot be cited as a pricing page, and price questions
 * ("is OpenShorts free", "cheaper than Opus Clip") are answered from pages that
 * are one. The homepage table stays; this page states the same plans in plain
 * HTML for readers and engines that never run the app.
 *
 * Every number is read from data.js (PRICE_MODELS.openshorts, EDITIONS), which
 * mirrors cloud/config.py PLAN_MINUTES and the Stripe catalog. The plan buttons
 * are the existing app deep links /pricing?plan=<plan>[&interval=year]: nginx
 * sends a /pricing request that carries `plan` or `src` to the plan picker at
 * /#/pricing?..., and serves this page for everything else (utm_* included).

<h2>What each plan is for</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-hosted ($0)</strong>: you have a machine with Docker (an NVIDIA GPU helps) and want no meter at all, or need the video to stay on your own hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Free</strong>: to see the clips on one of your own videos before paying anything.</li>
<li><strong>Starter (${money(PAID[0].monthly.price)}/month, ${PAID[0].monthly.minutes} minutes)</strong>: one or two long videos a month without a watermark.</li>
<li><strong>Creator (${money(PAID[1].monthly.price)}/month, ${PAID[1].monthly.minutes} minutes)</strong>: a weekly podcast or show.</li>
<li><strong>Pro (${money(PAID[2].monthly.price)}/month, ${PAID[2].monthly.minutes} minutes)</strong>: daily uploads, several channels, or clients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What every Cloud plan includes</h2>
<p>The same pipeline as the open source code, with the GPU and the API keys
covered: AI moment detection, 9:16 reframing that follows the speaker (two
speakers stacked, screen recordings kept readable), word-level captions, hook
overlays, the clip editor, direct posting to YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels and
TikTok, the REST API and the MCP server. API and MCP jobs use the same minutes
as the dashboard, with no per-call fee.</p>

<h2>Paying by the source minute</h2>
<p>Most AI clippers bill by the minute of video you import, and so does
OpenShorts Cloud. For comparison, checked ${esc(opus.checked)}: Opus Clip starts
at ${esc(opus.entryPrice)} for 150 minutes, and Vizard at ${esc(vizard.entryPrice)}
for 600 minutes. Per minute, Vizard is the cheaper of the three at volume;
OpenShorts is the cheapest of the three to start and the only one you can run yourself. The
<a href="/alternatives">alternatives page</a> has every tool's plans.</p>
